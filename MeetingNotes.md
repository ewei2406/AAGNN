# Meeting Notes

## 10-26-21
Covered progress in creating "unlearnable" graphs, discussed ways to improve methods and further tests.

- Look into refining implementation of "unlearnable" paper.
- Test statement: Performance of Model trained on "unlearnable data" in training should be greater than performance Model trained on "clean" data in training.
- Look into different ways of going from gradient of adjacency matrix to discrete
    - Greedy algorithim
    - Other implementations of probability
